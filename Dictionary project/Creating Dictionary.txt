Dictionary Project:
1. You can use PyDictionary
	pip install PyDictionary #type this at terminal
#see how you will use Pydictionary

2. You can also use a json file
Approach:
a. Test how dictionary-json file works
b. User input: enter the word you want to define
c. Predefine a function that will translate the word entered so that you can
   use if-else statements for the different types of input
d. Consider first lowercases then uppercases for the input:
   title(), uppercase(), lowercase(), capitalize()
e. Print the different definitions in separate lines by using if statement and for
   statement inside it
f. Use get_close_matches for inputs that for mispelled words
	format of get_close_matches: get_close_matches["abc",x,cutoff=.8]
	#here the word is user input "abc"
	#x is where the close matches (list) is stored
	#then .8 is the accuracy rate, always allow errors (not too high accuracy) so that you can get close matches
